Pokemon team type comparison

The goal of this project is to create an app for checking the balance of type weaknesses and coverage for teambuilding purposes.

# Motivation and Goals
There are a few tools online already, so why create a new one? Well I want to combine ease of use with ease of maintenance. 
The easiest tool to use that I have seen is out of date by several years and the codebase is just awful.

## Goals:
* Quick pokemon/move selection
* Instant feedback
* Keep as much of the relevant information on the screen at once for quicker use.
* Future proof. Barring some major changes in the ecosystem this should continue to work and be up to date even if I abandon it.
